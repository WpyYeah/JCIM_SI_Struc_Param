# JCIM_SI_Struc_Param
General repository for the work "Use High-throughput Molecular Dynamics Simulation to Enhance the Computational Design of Kemp Elimination Enzymes" in ACS JCIM 

by Pengyu Wang, Jun Zhang, Shengyu Zhang, Diannan Lu* and Yushan Zhu*

The structures and parameter files used in this work can be found in this repository. 

The directory "MD_Simulations" contains: (1)The initial structures of key HG-series mutants for the input of MD simulations, (2)parameter files and the structure of the ligand used in MD simulations and (3)the running parameter files of three MD simulation schemes.

The directory "PRODA_Recapitulation" contains: (1)The parameter files, Script files, enzymes and ligands structures used in the recapitulation of five key HG-series mutants by PRODA and (2)the recapitulation results of the structures of HG3, HG3.3b, HG3.7, HG3.14 and HG3.17 by PRODA.

The directory "PRODA_Redesign" contains: (1) The parameters files, Script file enzymes and ligands structures used in the computational redesign of HG3.17 by PRODA and (2)the PRODA-designed enzyme-TS complex structures of top-ranked 12 mutants in MD-based evaluations.
